//! Notification subsystem.
//!
//! [`NotificationPayload`] defines *what* a notification carries.
//! [`NotificationManager`] owns the delivery logic:
//!
//! * If the target user has an open notification stream, the message is sent
//!   directly over WebTransport (zero DB round-trip).
//! * Otherwise it is persisted to the `notifications` table so it can be
//!   drained when the user reconnects.
//!
//! # Opening a notification stream
//!
//! Call [`NotificationManager::open_stream`] once per WebTransport session.
//! It will:
//!
//! 1. Request a uni-directional stream from [`StreamManager`](crate::stream::StreamManager).
//! 2. Drain every pending row from the DB (oldest first).
//! 3. Register the stream so subsequent [`send`](NotificationManager::send)
//!    calls go straight to the wire.
